title: when alignment happens
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

```
Alignment happens only for operators with multiple predecessors (joins) as well as operators with multiple senders (after a stream repartitioning/shuffle). Because of that, dataflows with only embarrassingly parallel streaming operations (map(), flatMap(), filter(), â€¦) actually give exactly once guarantees even in at least once mode.
