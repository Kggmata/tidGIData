title: Immersion reading
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Immersion reading is a reading technique that involves using ''text-to-speech software'' to listen to a written text while ''following along with the written words on a screen or in a physical book''. The goal of immersion reading is to enhance the reading experience and improve comprehension by engaging ''both the auditory and visual senses''. This technique can be particularly useful for ''language learners'', as it allows them to ''hear the correct pronunciation of words and phrases while also seeing the written form''. It can also be helpful for people with learning disabilities or those who prefer to learn through auditory rather than visual means. To try immersion reading, you will need a device with text-to-speech capabilities, such as a smartphone or tablet with a reading app, or a computer with text-to-speech software installed. Simply select the text you want to read, choose a text-to-speech voice, and adjust the speed and volume to your preference. As you listen to the text being read aloud, follow along with the written words to reinforce your understanding.
