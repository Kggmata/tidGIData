title: why heap can implement as array to save space but binary search tree can't?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

```
Array-representation is based on level-order traversal. They are best suitable for full layers.
Heaps are complete binary trees, therefore first h-1 layer are full. 
BST is not required to be a complete binary tree.
